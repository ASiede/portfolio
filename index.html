			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a full stack web developer and recent graduate of the Thinkful's Full Stack Program. Since discovering my passion and skill for coding I've never looked back. I'm truly excited to learn as much as I can and tackle the next challenge, whether it is learning a new language, framework, hack, etc. or building an app to solve a problem or need. I'm as happy creating an gorgeous, intuitive front end as I am building an efficient, maintainable back end. Essentially, seeing people excitedly navigate my products with ease, gives me a coding high.</p>
			<p>When I'm not coding, you can typically find me getting dirty in the outdoors, camping, hiking, or kayaking, or channeling my inner Messi playing soccer. I'm also a movie addict who can probably name that guy who was in that thing.</p>
